## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps:

### 📧 Private Disclosure
1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to the maintainers with details
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow 48-72 hours for initial response

### 🔍 What to Include
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 🔑 Secrets Management
- **Never commit** sensitive data (tokens, passwords, API keys)
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD authentication
- Rotate tokens regularly
- Use environment variables for configuration

### 📊 SonarQube Security
- Keep SonarQube tokens secure
- Use least-privilege access
- Monitor security hotspots in analysis
- Address vulnerabilities promptly

### 🛠️ Development Security
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use security linting tools
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper authentication
- Use HTTPS in production

## 🚫 Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Never Do This
```javascript
// DON'T: Hardcode secrets
const API_KEY = "sk-1234567890abcdef";

// DON'T: Log sensitive data
console.log("User password:", password);

// DON'T: Use weak authentication
if (password === "admin") { /* ... */ }
```

### ✅ Do This Instead
```javascript
// DO: Use environment variables
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;

// DO: Log safely
console.log("Authentication attempt for user:", username);

// DO: Use proper authentication
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword);
```
